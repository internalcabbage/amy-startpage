# startpage
The startpage I created so that it fits with the rest of my configuration/setup.
i have never touched html/css/js in my life so this will start horribly

# How to use:
## Firefox:
To use as the new window page on firefox, make sure the index.html and main.css are in the same directory, if you cloned the repo it will be `~/amy-startpage/`. Then go to settings >> home >> new windows and tabs >> and set homepage and new windows to the location of the files. If you cloned the repository (on a UNIX-like system), it would be `file:///home/<USERNAME>/startpage/index.html`.

To use as the new tab page, [follow this guide by n6v26r.](https://github.com/n6v26r/.dotfiles/blob/main/firefox.md)

## Chrome
idk im normal if someone else uses chrome you can put instructions but im not going to download it just for that
